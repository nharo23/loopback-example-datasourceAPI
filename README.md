This is an example of standing up a API connected to a backend datasource using Loopback 2.0. This API is using an mySQL database backend and will add a db mapped "account" model in addition to the independent "person" model described in the earlier example. The API can be visualized using the API explorer shipped with Loopback framework. After clonig this app, please run npm install within the application directory to download and install the dependent modules from npm global registry.
